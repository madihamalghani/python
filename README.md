# Python
### 1.pyttsx3:
pyttsx3 is a Python library that allows your program to convert text into speech.
It works offline, meaning you don't need an internet connection to use it.
With this, you can make your Python program talk by inputting any text, and the computer will read it out loud.

### Lists:
Mutable and conatin different data types. Their value is written in [ ]
### Tuples:
same as list but immutable. Contains different data types. There value is written in ( )
### Dictionary:
unordered, mutable, indexed, can not contain duplicate keys
### Sets:
- collection of non-repetitive elements
- order is not maintained in sets
- unindexed
- there is no way to change items in set
- can not contain duplicate values
## Recursion:
- Recursion is a specific type of function where the function calls itself as part of its operation.
- The recursive function typically solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.
- Recursion must have a base case to stop the recursion, or it will lead to an infinite loop.
- Each recursive call reduces the size of the problem until it reaches the base case, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns a result.

## File Handlers:
In Python, file handlers are objects used to interact with files. When you open a file, you create a file handler (or file object), which lets you perform operations like reading, writing, or appending data to the file.

## Inheritance:
Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that lets a new class (child class) take on properties and behaviors of an existing class (parent class). This allows the child class to reuse and extend the code from the parent class without rewriting it, helping organize and simplify the code. Types include:
  #### 1.Single Inheritance:
   - A class inherits from just one parent class.
   - Example: Dog inherits from Animal.
  #### 2.Multiple Inheritance:
   - A class inherits from more than one parent class.
   - Example: FlyingCar inherits from both Car and Airplane.
  #### 3.Multilevel Inheritance:
   - A class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from a third class.
   - Example: Grandchild inherits from Child, which inherits from Parent.
  #### 4.Hierarchical Inheritance:
   - Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.
   - Example: Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal.
  #### 5.Hybrid Inheritance:
   - A mix of two or more types of inheritance, like combining multilevel and multiple inheritance.
   - Example: A class that inherits from both Parent and Grandparent classes through different paths.
