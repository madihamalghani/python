# Python
### 1.pyttsx3:
pyttsx3 is a Python library that allows your program to convert text into speech.
It works offline, meaning you don't need an internet connection to use it.
With this, you can make your Python program talk by inputting any text, and the computer will read it out loud.

### Lists:
Mutable and conatin different data types. Their value is written in [ ]
### Tuples:
same as list but immutable. Contains different data types. There value is written in ( )
### Dictionary:
unordered, mutable, indexed, can not contain duplicate keys
### Sets:
- collection of non-repetitive elements
- order is not maintained in sets
- unindexed
- there is no way to change items in set
- can not contain duplicate values
## Recursion:
- Recursion is a specific type of function where the function calls itself as part of its operation.
- The recursive function typically solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.
- Recursion must have a base case to stop the recursion, or it will lead to an infinite loop.
- Each recursive call reduces the size of the problem until it reaches the base case, at which point the function stops calling itself and returns a result.
